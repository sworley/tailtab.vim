This is a plugin that lets you view multiple log files or any files of interest that are modified externally. The files are opened in read 
only mode.

:TailView /tmp/foo /var/log/bar ...

will open as many new tabs as files and you can update the file from disk using the 
<Ctrl-K> keypress in normal mode. Also when you swich tabs using the gt command the file gets updated from disk automatically.

Of course you can use the TAB key to complete file names.

Normal vim usage is not affected in any way. Only files opened with the TailView command are in read only mode and updated from disk
automatically when you enter that tab
